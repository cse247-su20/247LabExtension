# Possible Extensions for Hash Lab

Can students find solutions online? Absolutely; it's not like these are unsolved problems. Perhaps a mini-writeup explaining their solution would suffice.

## Most common n base-pair DNA sequence

Baljeet the Bear loves to follow trends. He recently decided to try out 37andMe. 

Po the Panda Bear recently quit his role as Dragon Warrior, champion of the Valley of Peace. He now works behind the scenes at 37andMe. His job is to identify frequently-occurring DNA sequences that occur throughout genomes. Imagine you are Po.

You have just received Baljeet’s DNA sequence as a string. You must now find the most commonly occurring n-base pair DNA sequence in Baljeet’s DNA. You may *not* assume Baljeet’s DNA length is greater than n. If there are multiple sequences with the same number of occurences, print the sequence of lowest lexicographic order. (hint: what studio did we compare Strings in?)

Implement a function that does this. As you were the previous Dragon Warrior, we expect no worse than linear amortized time.

__OBJECTIVE:__

Finish the commonSequence class

## TwoSum using Java API's HashMap<Integer, Integer>

One day, you attend a technical interview only to find that Baljeet is your interviewer. Baljeet gives you this question:

Given an array of type int, determine the indices where two elements sum to a target sum. The indices ought to be in sorted order. The two cannot be the same element. If more than one solution exists, print the earliest-appearing pair that sums to the given target. If there is no solution, print '-1'.

Baljeet is a very picky interviewer, and he will accept no less than the optimal solution. Can you get the job done? The naive solution looks to be quadratic in terms of input, but a clever usage of what you learned this past week might help :). If optimized, your code should run in linear time.

__EXAMPLE:__

A = [1,4,5,3,1,8]

target = 7

return: "1 3" because the indices at 1 and 3 hold 4 and 3, respectively. 4 + 3 = 7.

__OBJECTIVE:__

Finish the TwoSum class
